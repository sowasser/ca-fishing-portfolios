## Data source

These data were collected from PDFs of the Final Californial Commercial Landings data for 2000-2019, downloaded from the [California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CADFW)][1]. The data are aggregated into nine areas, from North to South: Eureka, Fort Bragg, Bodega Bay, San Francisco, Monterey, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego (Figure 1). Landings are reported for each month.

## Fisheries of interest

The data set includes over 300 species, so to focus the analysis and reduce the number of variables, the most highly-landed species and fisheries were isolated as fisheries of interest (Figure 2). While some fisheries, e.g. Dungeness crab, consist of a single species, other species were combined to form a fishery determined by habitat and gear type. 'Groundfish' incorporates the following species and species complexes: California halibut, rockfish, thornyhead, sablefish, skate, leopard shark, soupfin shark, spiny dogfish, grenadiers, cabezon, greenling, cod, lingcod, Pacific whiting, scorpionfish, flounder, sole, and sanddab. Species selection for groundfish was based on the [CADFW List of Federally Managed Groundfish Species][2]. 'Pelagics' consists of Pacific sardine, Pacific mackerel, Jack mackerel, and Northern anchovy, following the [NOAA West Coast Coastal Pelagic Species][3] definition. Market squid were not included in pelagics as they constitute a large proportion of landings on their own. Other generalizations are for Pacific ocean and pink ocean shrimp, red and yellow rock crab, salmon, and hagfish. 

While fisheries landings are important for understanding fishing patterns and portfolio-building, landing quantity does not necessarily equal revenue importance. Based on the all-state revenue data from the California Department of Natural Resources California North Coast MPA Baseline Study, 1992-2014, spot prawn was included as a species of interst. Because of the lack of generalization to the other areas, the San Francisco brine shrimp fishery was excluded, despite being one of the most-landed species for the area. With 19 fisheries excluded as fisheries of interest, the 'other' category represents 0.95% of the mean landings for the dataset (Figure 2).

Landings of the fisheries of interest are distributed differently over the year (Figures 3 & 4). Some fisheries are landed relatively evenly across the year, such as red sea urchin and rock crab, while others are highly seasonal, such as herring roe, Pacific bonito, salmon, spiny lobster, and yellowfin & skipjack tuna (Figure 3).

## Spatial variation in fisheries of interest

There is also a difference in the spatial distribution of landings for the most-landed species (dungeness crab, groundfish, herring roe, ocean shrimp, pelagics, red sea urchin, salmon, and market squid) (Figure 4). No salmon were landed in the most southern areas (Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego) and herring roe only in Bodega Bay and San Francisco. No or few coastal pelagics were landed in the Northern areas (Eureka, Fort Bragg, Bodega Bay). The number of high-landings fisheries landed per area varies, with only three species landed for the most southern areas, and the most species landed in Bodega Bay, San Francisco, and Morro Bay. For all eight most-landed species, there was a significant difference between the areas (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.05).

## Yearly variation in fisheries of interest

Over the 20-year time-series (2000-2019), there is inevitable variation in landigns of the fisheries of interest. Of the eight most-landed species, there was a significant difference, determine with a Kruskal-Wallis test, between the years for five: Market squid (p = 0.033), pelagics (p < 0.005), groundfish (p < 0.005), red sea urchin (p < 0.005), and salmon (p = 0.028) (Figures 5-12). There was no significant difference for the other three fisheries (Dungeness crab, ocean shrimp, herring roe) (Figures 5-12).
