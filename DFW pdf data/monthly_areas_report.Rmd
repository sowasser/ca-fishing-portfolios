## Data source

These data were collected from PDFs of the Final Californial Commercial Landings data for 2000-2019, downloaded from the [California Department of Fish and Wildlife][1]. The data are aggregated into nine areas, from North to South: Eureka, Fort Bragg, Bodega Bay, San Francisco, Monterey, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego (Figure 1). Landings are reported for each month.

## Fisheries of interest

Landings were reported for every fisheries species in each area, and so to focus the analysis and reduce the number of variables, ten species/species groups were selected as fisheries of interest.
